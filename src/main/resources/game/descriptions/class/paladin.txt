The paladin is a hybrid class with the ability to play all three major roles, including healing, tanking and DPS. They have auras, blessings and seals that provide useful buffs for other players while wearing plate armor to heavily mitigate damage and strong defensive abilities. Paladins are considered holy knights[1] or blood knights. Paladins begin the game able to wear plate. Paladins can use a shield. Paladins use melee weapons, including one- and two-handed axes, maces and swords, as well as polearms.
