Priests are masters of healing and preservation. Infused with the Light, they can restore their wounded allies, shield them in battle, and even resurrect them. While they have a variety of protective and enhancement spells to bolster their allies, they can also wreak terrible vengeance on their enemies, using the grand powers of the Holy Light to smite and purge, or the devastating powers of the shadow to decimate their minds. The priest is a diverse and powerful class, highly desirable in any group and capable of fulfilling multiple roles.
