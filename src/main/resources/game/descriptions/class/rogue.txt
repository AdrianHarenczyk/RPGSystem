Rogues are melee damage dealers. They have access to a wide range of specials that depend on their constantly refilling pool of energy. Unlike other classes, rogues should be in close to attack. The primary advantage rogues have is their ability to stealth. Unless the rogue is very close and in a 180 degree arc in front of them, or much lower level, players are usually unable to see them. Rogues can only wear leather or cloth armor, are unable to use shields, and can only wield one-handed weapons (daggers, swords, maces, fist weapons, and axes). They can dual wield one-handed weapons. Rogues have moderate health, making them less durable than warriors, but still tougher than most casters.
