Warriors are melee fighters highly trained in the art of weaponry. Melee combat is the warrior's strongest skill. They are strong and quick on the battlefield. Depending on their specialization, a warrior can often deal very high damage or be tough to kill. Warrior abilities depend on rage generation. This is different to all but one melee class, the bear form druid. Rage for Arms and Fury is generates through auto-attacks, while rage for Protection warriors is generated primarily through taking damage. Warriors wear plate, and at level 50 they receive [Plate Specialization]. They are able to use shields, wear a variety of armor, and wield any weapon with the exception of wands. Warrior is one of the two classes playable by all races, Hunter being the other.
