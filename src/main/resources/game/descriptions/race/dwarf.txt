Dwarves are short and stocky, but as heavy as a human. They are broad and stable creatures,
perfectly suited to working close to the earth. Their thick fingers are capable of surprisingly
fine manipulations, while their strength allows them to dig through all but the hardest stone.
The men grow beards as a matter of pride, only trimming them enough to keep them tidy, and they
enjoy braiding and ornamenting them, especially for special occasions.
