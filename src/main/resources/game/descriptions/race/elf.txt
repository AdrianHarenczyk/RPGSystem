Among the oldest of the races, save for only a very few exceptions, high elves are the first elves, the oldest of the race, and the inheritors and originators of the grand and ancient elven culture. All other races of elf are, thus, subraces of the high elves. The great ruling families of Aelfheim are all high elves as well, and these elves make up the aristocracy of the elven people as a whole. All elves, save for drow and wildrunner elves, acknowledge the inherent right of the high elves to rule their people by dint of birthright as well as skill, and bow to that authority.
