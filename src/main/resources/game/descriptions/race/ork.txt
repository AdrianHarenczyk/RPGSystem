Orks are a Proud Warrior Race with an extensive honor system. They've been referred to as "green Klingons" in the past. Their honor system may be inspired by the Japanese, the Norse, or other "warrior" cultures. Have intelligence on par with humans and other races (though other races might not see it that way). Their technology and magic might even be on par with humans and elves, though their magic will be more shamanic than arcane, and their technology will be more "earthy".
